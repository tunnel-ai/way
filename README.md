Notes to future me:

- run 'smoke_test.py` from project root to verify it works
  `uv run python notebooks/smoke_test.py`


clone the repo in a fresh folder to check it still works... check for init files if it doesn't

!git clone https://github.com/<USER>/<REPO>.git
!pip -q install -e <REPO>

update to main
